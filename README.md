# Insurance-Management

Comprehensive software for staff of an insurance company to add and update records based on a variety of fields. Instead of using SQLalchemy, I first created the database in MSSQL (using the creator file),
and then built a software allowing users to upload a csv file is parsed and added to the table. Also functionality for adding records to tables manually, and login/logout functionality using the flask_login
module. Used Flask to create the backend, with HTML templates and using Bootstrap as well as styles.css for stylization purposes.
